// Core FAQs (hybrid of your original + best of long-form draft)
const faqs = [
  {
    q: "Do I legally need a transfer switch?",
    a: `For permanently installed standby or whole-home generators, a listed transfer switch (usually automatic) is the standard. For portable generators, many jurisdictions allow listed panel interlock kits that prevent backfeed. Local adoption and interpretation of the NEC vary, so always verify with your Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) and utility.`
  },
  {
    q: "Is a generator interlock kit as safe as a transfer switch?",
    a: `When properly listed for the panel and installed by a licensed electrician, an interlock kit is designed to achieve the same core safety objective as a transfer switch: preventing simultaneous connection of the utility and generator and avoiding dangerous backfeed into utility lines. Both approaches rely on listed devices and correct installation to be safe.`
  },
  {
    q: "What size transfer switch or interlock breaker do I need?",
    a: `You size the transfer equipment to the generator feeder and conductors, not to your main service rating. Common sizes are 30 A, 50 A, and 100 A. For example, a 7,500 W–8,500 W portable generator often uses a 30 A or 50 A inlet and breaker. Many 200 A homes use a 100 A transfer switch feeding a managed “critical loads” sub-panel.`
  },
  {
    q: "How much does a transfer switch install cost in 2025?",
    a: `Typical installed ranges (parts + labor + permit): around $800–$1,800 for smaller (100 A) services and $1,200–$3,500 for 200 A services, depending on brand, distance to inlet, panel space, and local labor rates. Whole-home / high-amp or service-upgrade projects can run $2,500–$5,000+.`
  },
  {
    q: "How much does an interlock kit install cost in 2025?",
    a: `For most homes, a professionally installed interlock kit lands roughly in the $350–$1,000 range depending on service size, brand, panel compatibility, and local labor rates. The interlock plate itself is usually $100–$350, plus a generator breaker, inlet box, wiring, permit, and labor.`
  },
  {
    q: "Will my insurance company accept a generator interlock instead of a transfer switch?",
    a: `Many major insurers accept both transfer switches and listed interlock kits, as long as they’re installed by a licensed electrician with proper permits and inspection. Some carriers may offer small discounts (often in the low single-digits) for professionally installed backup power systems. Always confirm with your insurer before installation.`
  },
  {
    q: "Can I install a generator interlock or transfer switch myself?",
    a: `In most places, work inside the main electrical panel and installation of transfer equipment require a licensed electrician and an electrical permit. Even if DIY were technically allowed where you live, unpermitted work can create problems with insurance and future home sales. The safest, simplest path is to have a licensed electrician handle the installation.`
  },
  {
    q: "Can an interlock kit work with a whole-house standby generator?",
    a: `No. Permanently installed standby generators (Generac, Kohler, etc.) are designed to work with automatic transfer switches (ATS). The system monitors utility power and transfers automatically. Interlock kits are meant for portable generator applications where you manually start the generator and manage loads.`
  },
  {
    q: "Can I power my whole house with an interlock kit?",
    a: `An interlock gives you access to every circuit in the panel, but your generator’s wattage still sets the ceiling. In practice, you run “whole house, but not whole house at once”: you selectively enable and disable circuits so you don’t overload the generator. High-draw loads (like electric ranges or large AC units) are often run one at a time.`
  },
  {
    q: "Are interlock kits really code-compliant?",
    a: `The NEC allows listed transfer equipment that physically prevents the utility and generator from being connected at the same time. Listed interlock kits that are specifically approved for your panel fall into this category. Local interpretation can differ, so your AHJ has the final say on what is acceptable in your area.`

        <strong>Standby / whole-home systems → use a listed transfer switch (usually automatic).</strong><br />
        <strong>Portable generators → a listed panel interlock kit is often the best value</strong> where local code and your panel

      <ol class="decision">
        <li>
          <strong>What type of generator?</strong><br />
          If it’s a <strong>standby / whole-home generator</strong>, you’ll be using an <strong>automatic transfer switch (ATS)</strong>
          or a listed manual transfer switch designed for that system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Portable generator feeding your home?</strong><br />
          If you want to feed selected circuits or a whole panel with a portable generator:
          <ul>
            <li>If your AHJ and utility allow listed interlocks and your panel has a listed kit → an <strong>interlock kit</strong> is usually the most flexible and cost-effective choice.</li>
            <li>If interlocks are not accepted or your panel has no listed kit → use a <strong>manual transfer switch</strong> or consider a panel upgrade.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Critical-loads vs whole panel?</strong><br />
          <ul>
            <li>Want simple “flip one switch and go” behavior for a few essential circuits? → <strong>Transfer switch with critical-loads sub-panel.</strong></li>
            <li>Want the ability to power any circuit as needed (but not all at once)? → <strong>Interlock kit.</strong></li>
          </ul>

    <section id="pros-cons">
      <h2>4. Pros &amp; cons of each option</h2>

      <h3>Transfer switch: advantages</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pre-wired critical circuits.</strong> You and your family always know exactly which loads will run during
          an outage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clean separation.</strong> A dedicated device clearly separates utility and generator power, which some
          homeowners and inspectors find reassuring.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Future-proof for standby.</strong> A manual transfer switch can be a stepping stone toward an automatic
          standby generator later.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fits older or incompatible panels.</strong> Because transfer switches live outside the main panel, they
          work even when no listed interlock exists for your panel.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Transfer switch: drawbacks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Higher upfront cost.</strong> Typically several hundred to a couple thousand dollars more than an interlock.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited circuits.</strong> Often 6–10 circuits only, so you may have to make hard choices about what’s
          “critical.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>More wall space and wiring.</strong> The extra enclosure and wiring runs can be challenging in tight
          utility rooms.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Interlock kit: advantages</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Lower cost with strong flexibility.</strong> You can usually power any circuit in the home, as long as
          you respect the generator’s limits.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Whole-panel access.</strong> You are not locked into a fixed set of “emergency” circuits.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Compact installation.</strong> No extra wall box—everything happens at the existing panel.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fast professional installs.</strong> Many jobs can be completed in one to three hours by an experienced electrician.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Interlock kit: drawbacks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Requires basic load management.</strong> You must understand that you can’t run every high-draw load at
          once on a modest portable generator.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Panel compatibility matters.</strong> You need a listed kit specifically approved for your panel model.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Panel space.</strong> A dedicated generator breaker slot must be available or created.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="micro-conclusion">
        For most portable-generator setups in modern homes with compatible panels, a listed interlock kit offers the best
        balance of safety, flexibility, and cost. Transfer switches still shine where panel compatibility or simplicity for
        the end user is the top priority.

      <h2>5. Code, insurance &amp; DIY reality</h2>

      <h3>Code and NEC considerations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The National Electrical Code (NEC) requires a means of transfer that prevents the utility and generator from
          being connected at the same time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Listed generator interlock kits that are specifically approved for your panel are one way to meet this
          requirement. Manual and automatic transfer switches are another.
        </li>
        <li>
          Local adoption and enforcement vary. Your AHJ (building department, electrical inspector) has final say on
          what’s acceptable in your area.
        </li>
        <li>
          Generator neutral and grounding configurations can be tricky. Your electrician should confirm whether the
          generator neutral is switched or unswitched and how that interacts with the main bonding jumper at your service.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Insurance and documentation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Some insurers offer modest discounts (often in the 2–5% range) for professionally installed backup power
          systems that reduce the risk of frozen pipes, sump pump failures, and food spoilage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whether you choose a transfer switch or interlock, insurers typically care most about permits, inspections, and
          professional installation—not the specific device.
        </li>
        <li>
          A quick call before you start the project can clarify eligibility, what documentation you’ll need, and whether
          your carrier has any preferences.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>DIY vs hiring an electrician</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Work inside the main panel and installation of transfer equipment usually require a licensed electrician and
          permit. This protects you, the next homeowner, and your electrician.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can still save by doing legwork: confirming panel model numbers, choosing the right kit, and getting
          multiple quotes. Many electricians are happy to install homeowner-supplied hardware if it’s properly listed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Paying for a professional install also protects you with their licensing, bonding, and liability coverage if
          something goes wrong.
        </li>
      </ul>
