const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What size generator do I need to run a house with two AC units?",
    a: "Two central AC systems are usually the limiting factor in residential backup. Typical homes with two 2–3 ton systems and gas heat often land in the mid-20 kW standby range, while larger or less efficient systems may need 26–30 kW or more. The safest approach is to pull nameplate data for both systems, estimate running and starting kW, then confirm with a load calculator and a licensed electrician."
  },
  {
    q: "Will a 10,000 watt generator run central air?",
    a: "Sometimes. A 10 kW portable can sometimes run a smaller, efficient 2–2.5 ton system with a good surge rating, soft-start kit, and careful load management. Larger or older systems, or homes with other heavy loads, often push beyond what a 10 kW portable can comfortably handle."
  },
  {
    q: "How many watts does it take to start a 4-ton AC unit?",
    a: "Many 4-ton single-stage systems draw roughly 4,000–6,500 W running, but can need 10,000–18,000 W of short-term starting capacity without a soft-start kit. The best indicator is the condenser’s locked-rotor amps (LRA) multiplied by 240 V."
  },
  {
    q: "What size generator do I need to run a 5-ton AC unit?",
    a: "A 5-ton AC is a large residential load. Running draw is often in the 5,000–7,500 W range, with starting demand that can exceed 15,000 W. Most homes that truly need a 5-ton system are in standby-generator territory, often in the mid-20 kW and up range depending on other loads and whether load management and soft-start modules are used."
  },
  {
    q: "How many watts does a typical whole-house AC system use?",
    a: "A rough rule of thumb: 2 ton ≈ 2,000–3,500 W, 3 ton ≈ 3,000–4,500 W, 4 ton ≈ 4,000–6,500 W, and 5 ton ≈ 5,000–7,500 W running. Actual draw varies with efficiency, design, and blower size, and starting watts can be 2–3× those running values without soft-start or inverter technology."
  },
  {
    q: "What size generator do I need to run a window AC unit?",
    a: "Smaller window units (5,000–8,000 BTU) often run on 400–800 W with 1,200–2,000 W starting, while larger 10,000–12,000 BTU units may draw 800–1,400 W with up to ~3,000 W starting. A 2,000–3,000 W inverter often handles one small-to-medium unit plus lights, while 3,000–4,000 W can support a larger unit and a refrigerator with careful management."
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need soft-start kits if I plan to run AC on a generator?",
    a: "Soft-start or hard-start kits are not always required, but often make the difference between marginal and reliable performance. They reduce compressor inrush current, help prevent nuisance trips, and can allow a smaller generator to handle a system that would otherwise be out of reach when installed and matched correctly by HVAC and electrical pros."

        If you’re new to generator sizing, you may want to start with the
        <a href="/generator-sizing-guide">Home Generator Sizing Guide</a> or
        the <a href="/faqs/general">General Generator FAQs</a> before diving into
        AC-specific details.
      </p>

      <h2>What size generator do I need to run a house with two AC units?</h2>
      <p>
        Two central AC systems are almost always the limiting factor in a residential
        backup setup. The exact generator size depends on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The tonnage of each system (2&nbsp;ton vs. 3–5&nbsp;ton).</li>
        <li>How efficient they are (older vs. newer high-SEER units).</li>
        <li>Whether soft-start or hard-start kits are installed.</li>
        <li>What <em>else</em> you want running at the same time (pumps, range, dryer, etc.).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As a rough range for typical U.S. homes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Two <strong>2–3&nbsp;ton</strong> systems with gas heat and mostly gas appliances
          often land in the <strong>24–26&nbsp;kW standby</strong> range for “most of the house”
          coverage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Two larger <strong>3–4&nbsp;ton</strong> systems plus higher plug loads or some
          electric heat may require <strong>26–30&nbsp;kW or more</strong> to run both systems
          and major household loads comfortably.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Installers commonly use load management modules so that only <strong>one compressor
        starts at a time</strong>. Even if both AC systems run together, staggering start-up
        reduces the instantaneous surge the generator has to cover.
      </p>
      <p>
        The safest way to size for two systems is to:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Collect the nameplate data (amps, volts, “LRA” or locked-rotor amps) for both condensers and air handlers.</li>
        <li>Estimate running kW and starting kW for each system.</li>
        <li>Run those numbers through a load calculator and then have an electrician confirm.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Will a 10,000&nbsp;watt generator run central air?</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes — but only under the right conditions, and usually for a
        <strong>single smaller system</strong> with careful load management.
      </p>
      <p>
        A typical <strong>2–3&nbsp;ton</strong> single-stage central AC system often has:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Running demand in the ballpark of <strong>2,500–4,500&nbsp;W</strong> (compressor + outdoor fan + indoor blower).</li>
        <li>A short starting surge that can be <strong>2–3× the running watts</strong> without a soft-start kit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For a 10&nbsp;kW portable to work with central air, you usually need:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A system on the smaller/more efficient side (for example, 2–2.5&nbsp;ton, modern unit).</li>
        <li>A generator with a decent surge rating (many 10&nbsp;kW portables surge to 12–12.5&nbsp;kW).</li>
        <li>Ideally a <strong>soft-start or hard-start kit</strong> on the AC to reduce the inrush current.</li>
        <li>Very careful load management: start the AC first, then add other loads like the fridge, lights, and well pump.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If your system is larger (3–4&nbsp;ton), older, or you have other heavy loads that
        need to run at the same time, a 10&nbsp;kW portable is often marginal for central
        air. In that case, many homeowners either:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the generator for essentials and window or mini-split units instead of central air, or</li>
        <li>Move up to a larger portable or a properly sized standby generator.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How many watts does it take to start a 4-ton AC unit?</h2>
      <p>
        Exact numbers depend on the specific equipment, but a 4-ton (≈48,000&nbsp;BTU)
        single-stage central AC system commonly looks like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Running demand</strong>: roughly <strong>4,000–6,500&nbsp;W</strong> for the
          compressor, condenser fan, and indoor blower combined on a typical system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Starting (surge) demand</strong>: often <strong>2–3× running</strong> for a
          fraction of a second if no soft-start kit is installed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many 4-ton systems therefore need <strong>10,000–18,000&nbsp;W of short-term starting
        capacity</strong> from the generator, even though the running load is far lower. The
        nameplate “LRA” (locked-rotor amps) on the condenser is the best indicator — multiply
        that by 240&nbsp;V to estimate peak starting VA.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Soft-start modules</strong> can significantly reduce that spike, sometimes
        bringing a system that would otherwise be out of reach for a mid-size generator into
        a workable range. It’s still important to confirm with a qualified HVAC and
        electrical pro before counting on a marginal setup.
      </p>

      <h2>What size generator do I need to run a 5-ton AC unit?</h2>
      <p>
        A 5-ton (≈60,000&nbsp;BTU) AC system is a large residential or light commercial load.
        Without soft-start equipment, many 5-ton condensers have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Running demand in the neighborhood of <strong>5,000–7,500&nbsp;W</strong>.</li>
        <li>Short-term starting demand that can exceed <strong>15,000&nbsp;W</strong> and sometimes much more, depending on LRA.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For most homes that truly need a 5-ton system, you’re generally in
        <strong>standby generator territory</strong>, not small portables. Common outcomes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>mid-20s&nbsp;kW</strong> standby unit may be adequate if you’re willing
          to limit what else runs during compressor start and use load management.
        </li>
        <li>
          Larger homes with significant additional loads (multiple refrigerators, pumps,
          office gear, electric appliances) often end up closer to
          <strong>24–30&nbsp;kW or more</strong> for comfortable operation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Again, the only way to know for sure is to pull the actual nameplate data, use a
        load calculator, and have an electrician verify the design.
      </p>

      <h2>How many watts does a typical whole-house AC system use?</h2>
      <p>
        For a conventional split-system central AC, a rough rule of thumb is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>2&nbsp;ton</strong> (≈24,000&nbsp;BTU): around <strong>2,000–3,500&nbsp;W running</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>3&nbsp;ton</strong> (≈36,000&nbsp;BTU): around <strong>3,000–4,500&nbsp;W running</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>4&nbsp;ton</strong> (≈48,000&nbsp;BTU): around <strong>4,000–6,500&nbsp;W running</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>5&nbsp;ton</strong> (≈60,000&nbsp;BTU): around <strong>5,000–7,500&nbsp;W running</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Actual values vary based on efficiency (SEER/EER), design (single-stage, two-stage,
        variable speed), ductwork, and blower size. The <strong>starting surge</strong> can
        be 2–3× those running values if the system does not use inverter technology or a
        soft-start module.
      </p>
      <p>
        Newer variable-speed or inverter-driven systems tend to have <strong>lower running
        watts and softer starts</strong>, which can make them easier to run on a generator
        than older, less efficient equipment of the same tonnage.
      </p>

      <h2>What size generator do I need to run a window AC unit?</h2>
      <p>
        Window units are much easier to back up with a small portable. Typical ranges:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>5,000–8,000&nbsp;BTU</strong> (small bedroom): about <strong>400–800&nbsp;W running</strong>, 1,200–2,000&nbsp;W starting.</li>
        <li><strong>10,000–12,000&nbsp;BTU</strong> (larger room): about <strong>800–1,400&nbsp;W running</strong>, up to ~3,000&nbsp;W starting.</li>
        <li><strong>15,000&nbsp;BTU and up</strong>: can approach <strong>1,800+&nbsp;W running</strong> with higher starting surge.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In practice:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>2,000–3,000&nbsp;W inverter generator</strong> can usually handle one
          small-to-medium window unit plus some lights and phone charging.
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>3,000–4,000&nbsp;W unit</strong> can often handle a larger window unit and
          a refrigerator, as long as big loads don’t start at the exact same moment.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Always check the unit’s nameplate or manual; some older or less efficient models
        draw considerably more power than newer, high-efficiency ones.
      </p>

      <h2>Do I need soft-start kits if I plan to run AC on a generator?</h2>
      <p>
        You don’t <em>always</em> need them, but they are often the difference between
        “works on paper” and “works reliably in real life,” especially with smaller
        generators.
      </p>
      <p>
        A properly sized soft-start or hard-start kit can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduce the instantaneous inrush current when the compressor starts.</li>
        <li>Help prevent nuisance tripping or voltage sag.</li>
        <li>Make it possible to use a generator that would otherwise be marginal.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These kits must be matched to the equipment and installed correctly, so this is
        a good place to involve both your HVAC contractor and electrician.
