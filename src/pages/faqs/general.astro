  {
    q: "How does generator sizing actually work?",
    a: "Sizing a home generator means adding up the running watts for the loads you care about, accounting for motor starting surges, and then choosing a generator that keeps typical peak usage around 70–80% of its rated output so it has headroom for hot weather and future loads.",
  },
  {
    q: "What size generator do most homes need?",
    a: "Smaller homes that only back up essentials often use 7–12 kW generators. Many 1,500–2,500 sq ft homes with gas heat and one central AC end up in the 16–24 kW standby range. Larger homes or those with multiple AC units or electric heat may need 24 kW or more. These are typical ranges, not guarantees.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a whole-house generator, or can I just back up essentials?",
    a: "You can choose an essentials-only setup with a portable generator and manual transfer switch, a standby unit feeding a limited circuit sub-panel, or a whole-house transfer switch with load management. Many homeowners are satisfied backing up only critical circuits, especially if outages are rare.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I rely on square footage alone to pick a generator size?",
    a: "No. Square footage is only a rough starting point. The biggest drivers of load are AC and heat pumps, whether major appliances use gas or electricity, and additional loads like wells, sump pumps, EV chargers, or pool equipment.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I calculate what size generator I need?",
    a: "List the rooms and systems you want powered, note the amps or watts from labels or manuals, convert amps to watts, add up the running watts you expect to use at the same time, add the largest motor starting surge, then add roughly 20–30% headroom. A load-based calculator plus a quick review by a licensed electrician is usually the most efficient approach.",
  },
  {
    q: "What’s the difference between running watts and starting watts?",
    a: "Running watts are what an appliance needs to keep operating under normal conditions. Starting watts are the brief spike when a motor first starts. Many motor loads draw roughly 2–3 times their running wattage for a short period, and the generator must be able to ride through that spike.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it worse to undersize or oversize a generator?",
    a: "Undersizing can cause nuisance tripping, brown-outs, and potential damage to sensitive electronics. Oversizing is safer electrically but costs more and can run inefficiently at very low loads. Most homeowners aim for a balanced size with a reasonable buffer instead of the smallest or largest option.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I still talk to an electrician if I use an online calculator?",
    a: "Yes. An online calculator is a good planning tool, but it does not replace on-site evaluation. A licensed electrician or generator installer should confirm loads, panel capacity, gas supply, grounding and bonding, and handle permits and inspections.",

      <h1>General Generator FAQs</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Big-picture answers to questions like “What size generator do I need?” and
        “How do I estimate my home’s load?” All focused on typical U.S. homes with
        residential optional standby generators.
      </p>
    </section>

    <main>
      <h2>How does generator sizing actually work?</h2>
      <p>
        Generator sizing comes down to three numbers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Running load</strong> – the watts (or kW) your home uses while everything is running normally.</li>
        <li><strong>Starting (surge) load</strong> – the temporary spike when motors start, like AC compressors and pumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Headroom</strong> – extra capacity (typically 20–30%) so the generator isn’t running at the ragged edge.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A good rule of thumb: add up the <strong>running watts</strong> for everything you plan
        to use during an outage, then add the <strong>single highest motor starting load</strong>.
        Choose a generator so your expected peak load is around <strong>70–80% of its rated
        output</strong>. This gives room for noise in the numbers, future loads, and hot-weather derating.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s no one-size-fits-all answer. Two homes with the same square footage can
        have very different electrical loads depending on fuel type (gas vs. electric
        appliances), number of AC units, well pumps, EV chargers, and so on.
      </p>

      <h2>What size generator do most homes need?</h2>
      <p>
        It depends on whether you want to power <strong>just essentials</strong> or
        <strong>nearly everything</strong> in the house:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Essentials-only (via portable or smaller standby)</strong>: Often
          <strong>7–12&nbsp;kW</strong> is enough to run a smaller central AC or several
          window units, refrigerator, some lighting, and key outlets — as long as you’re
          strategic about what runs at the same time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>“Most of the house” with one central AC</strong>: Many typical
          1,500–2,500&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft homes with gas heat and gas water heaters end up in the
          <strong>16–24&nbsp;kW</strong> standby range.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Larger homes or two+ AC systems</strong>: Homes with 3,000+&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft,
          multiple large AC units, or significant electric heat often require
          <strong>24&nbsp;kW and up</strong>, and sometimes 30&nbsp;kW+ depending on priorities.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are <strong>typical ranges</strong>, not guarantees. The safest approach is to
        use a load-based calculator (like the one on SizeMyGenerator.com) and then have a
        licensed electrician confirm the final size and transfer switch setup for your
        specific home.
      </p>

      <h2>Do I need a “whole-house” generator, or can I just back up essentials?</h2>
      <p>
        Not everyone needs or wants a whole-house system. You have three main options:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Portable generator + manual transfer switch</strong> – Lower cost. You
          select a limited set of circuits (fridge, a few rooms, possibly a smaller AC or
          window units, pumps). You manually manage loads.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Standby generator with limited-circuit transfer switch</strong> – Automatic
          startup, but only certain circuits are backed up (often 8–16 circuits).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Whole-house transfer switch with load management</strong> – The generator
          is connected to your entire panel, and smart modules shed lower-priority circuits
          automatically when needed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many homeowners are happy with a well-planned essentials-only setup, especially if
        outages are rare. In areas with frequent or extended outages, a properly sized
        whole-house system can be worth the extra cost and complexity.
      </p>

      <h2>Can I rely on square footage alone to pick a generator size?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>No.</strong> Square footage is a rough proxy at best. Load is driven much more
        by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Number and size of <strong>AC units</strong> and heat pumps.</li>
        <li>Whether <strong>heat, water heating, and cooking</strong> are gas or electric.</li>
        <li>Presence of <strong>wells, sump pumps, EV chargers, shop equipment</strong>, or pools.</li>
        <li>How many rooms you truly need powered during an outage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Rules like “X&nbsp;kW per Y&nbsp;square feet” can easily be off by 30–50%. They’re
        useful only as a starting point. A quick load-based calculation or using a generator
        sizing calculator will always be more accurate.
      </p>

      <h2>How do I calculate what size generator I need?</h2>
      <p>
        There are two basic approaches: a quick estimate and a more detailed load
        calculation.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Quick estimate:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>List the rooms and systems you care about during an outage (HVAC, fridge, well or sump pump, medical equipment, office, etc.).</li>
        <li>Note the <strong>amps</strong> or <strong>wattage</strong> from labels or manuals for each item.</li>
        <li>Convert amps to watts using <code>watts = volts × amps</code> (for most household loads, 120&nbsp;V or 240&nbsp;V).</li>
        <li>Add up all the running watts for the items you plan to run at the same time.</li>
        <li>Identify the appliance with the highest starting surge (often a central AC, well pump, or large compressor).</li>
        <li>Add that starting surge to your running total, then add 20–30% headroom.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>More precise method:</strong> electricians follow NEC-style load calculations
        that account for continuous vs. non-continuous loads, diversity factors, and your
        actual panel configuration. That’s more work by hand, which is why a calculator plus
        a quick professional review is usually the most efficient path.
      </p>

      <h2>What’s the difference between running watts and starting watts?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Running watts</strong> (sometimes labeled “rated watts” or “continuous kW”)
        are what an appliance needs to <em>keep</em> running. <strong>Starting watts</strong>
        (or “surge watts”) are the brief spike when the motor first kicks on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many motor loads draw <strong>2–3× their running current</strong> for a fraction of a
        second at startup. For example, a 1,000&nbsp;W well pump might momentarily need
        2,000–3,000&nbsp;W to start. Modern soft-start kits and variable-speed equipment can
        reduce this spike, but it still needs to be considered in sizing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generators are usually rated for a continuous output (for example,
        <strong>20&nbsp;kW</strong>) plus a slightly higher short-term surge rating. Your goal
        is to keep combined loads — including the biggest startup event — within what the
        generator can comfortably deliver.
      </p>

      <h2>Is it worse to undersize or oversize a generator?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Undersizing</strong> creates immediate problems: nuisance tripping, brown-outs
        when large loads start, and in the worst case, damage to sensitive electronics if
        voltage sags. If your generator is obviously too small for your chosen loads, you’ll
        be forced into inconvenient manual load shedding (flipping breakers on and off).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Oversizing</strong> is safer electrically but more expensive.
        Very light loading can also lead to poor fuel economy and, on some engines,
        sub-optimal operating conditions over long periods.
        Most homeowners aim for a balanced size with a modest buffer rather than the extremes.
      </p>

      <h2>Should I still talk to an electrician if I use an online calculator?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. A calculator is an excellent way to narrow the range quickly and understand
        trade-offs, but it <strong>doesn’t replace</strong> on-site evaluation. A licensed
        electrician or generator installer will:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Confirm your loads and priorities.</li>
        <li>Check panel capacity, grounding, and bonding.</li>
        <li>Verify gas service capacity for natural gas or tank sizing for propane.</li>
        <li>Handle permits, inspections, and transfer switch selection.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Think of the calculator as the “research and planning” step and the electrician as
        the final authority who makes sure everything is safe and code-compliant.
