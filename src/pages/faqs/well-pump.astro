      <h1>Well &amp; Sump Pump FAQs</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Well pumps and sump pumps create some of the highest starting loads in a
        typical home. These FAQs explain how many watts they need, what size
        generator can run them, and how to plan for safe operation during an outage.
      </p>
    </section>

    <main>
      <h2>What size generator do I need to run a well pump?</h2>
      <p>
        The required generator size depends on the <strong>horsepower (HP)</strong>
        of your pump and whether it uses a <strong>2-wire</strong> or
        <strong>3-wire</strong> motor. Typical residential well pumps range from
        <strong>1/2 HP to 1 HP</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>General estimates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1/2 HP well pump</strong>: ~1,000 W running, 2,000–4,000 W starting</li>
        <li><strong>3/4 HP well pump</strong>: ~1,500 W running, 3,000–5,000 W starting</li>
        <li><strong>1 HP well pump</strong>: ~2,000 W running, 4,000–6,000 W starting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Pumps often draw <strong>2–3× their running watts</strong> at startup. That short surge
        is what determines whether your generator is large enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a typical 1/2–1 HP well pump, a generator in the
        <strong>4,000–7,500 W</strong> range is often sufficient, depending on what
        else is running at the same time. Larger homes or higher HP pumps may require
        a 7,500–10,000 W portable or a standby system.
      </p>

      <h2>Can a portable generator run a well pump?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes—most portable generators in the <strong>4,000–7,500 W</strong> class can run
        a typical residential well pump, as long as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You’re not simultaneously starting other big motor loads.</li>
        <li>The generator has adequate surge capacity.</li>
        <li>The pump’s electrical circuit is connected via a transfer switch or interlock.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have a <strong>larger 1 HP pump</strong>, older equipment, or long wire
        runs (which increase starting demand), a <strong>larger 7,500–12,000 W
        portable</strong> may be more reliable.
      </p>

      <h2>How many watts does a typical well pump use?</h2>
      <p>
        It varies by motor type and HP rating, but these ranges cover most homes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Running watts</strong>: ~700–2,000 W</li>
        <li><strong>Starting watts</strong>: ~2,000–6,000 W</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The best way to know for sure is to check the pump’s nameplate or control box.
        If it lists <strong>FLA</strong> (full-load amps) and <strong>LRA</strong>
        (locked-rotor amps), you can convert to watts:
      </p>
      <pre><code>Watts = Amps × Volts</code></pre>
      <p>
        Example: a pump with 8 A FLA at 240 V uses roughly 1,920 W running.
      </p>

      <h2>Can a sump pump and well pump run on the same generator?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, but only if the generator can handle the <strong>combined starting load</strong>.
        Sump pumps also have significant inrush currents, although typically lower than well pumps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical sump pump ranges:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1/3 HP</strong>: 600–800 W running, 1,300–2,500 W starting</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 HP</strong>: 800–1,200 W running, 2,000–3,500 W starting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If both pumps start at the same time, the generator must handle:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Well pump surge (2,000–6,000 W)</li>
        <li>Plus sump pump surge (1,300–3,500 W)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is why many homes rely on a <strong>7,500–12,000 W portable</strong> or a
        right-sized standby unit when both pumps are mission-critical.
      </p>

      <h2>What size generator do I need for a well pump, sump pump, and fridge?</h2>
      <p>
        A very common “essentials-only” setup is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1/2–1 HP well pump</li>
        <li>1/3–1/2 HP sump pump</li>
        <li>Refrigerator/freezer</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In many cases, a generator in the <strong>7,500–10,000 W</strong> range works well
        for this combination, as long as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The pumps don’t start at the exact same moment.</li>
        <li>You’re not adding a major load (like a large AC or electric water heater).</li>
        <li>Your transfer switch wiring keeps these circuits isolated and safe.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Can I run a well pump directly off an extension cord?</h2>
      <p><strong>No.</strong> Well pumps are hard-wired appliances and should not be connected
      with an extension cord.</p>
      <p>
        To run a well pump from a generator, you need a
        <strong>transfer switch or interlock</strong> so the pump circuit can be powered safely
        without backfeeding the utility lines. Your electrician will make sure the
        neutral, grounding, and bonding requirements are correct for your generator type.
      </p>

      <h2>Does starting surge increase with pump age or wiring distance?</h2>
      <p>Yes—both can increase the current required at startup.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Aging pumps</strong> often draw higher inrush current as bearings wear
          and efficiency declines.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Longer wire runs</strong> to deep-well pumps add resistance, which can
          increase the starting VA the generator must supply.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If your well pump is older than 10–12 years or has a very long wiring run, lean toward
        the higher end of generator sizing ranges or ask an electrician to confirm the load.
      </p>

      <h2>What about jet pumps?</h2>
      <p>
        Jet pumps (commonly used in shallow wells) tend to have similar wattage requirements
        to submersible pumps of the same horsepower. A standard <strong>3/4 HP jet pump</strong>
        often needs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1,000–1,600 W running</li>
        <li>3,000–4,500 W starting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If your home uses a jet pump for both water supply and pressure boosting, factor
        that load into your generator plan just like a submersible well pump.
