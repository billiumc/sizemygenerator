  {
    q: "What size generator do I need to run a well pump?",
    a: "The required generator size depends on the pump horsepower, motor type, and what else is running at the same time. Typical residential well pumps range from 1/2 HP to 1 HP, with running demand roughly 700–2,000 W and starting demand commonly 2–3× higher. Many homes with a 1/2–1 HP pump are comfortable in the 4,000–7,500 W generator range if other big loads are limited, while larger homes or pumps may need 7,500–10,000 W or more."
  },
  {
    q: "Can a portable generator run a well pump?",
    a: "Yes. Most portable generators in the 4,000–7,500 W class can run a typical residential well pump if the generator has adequate surge capacity and you avoid starting other big motor loads at the exact same moment. The pump circuit should be connected through a proper transfer switch or interlock rather than cords."
  },
  {
    q: "How many watts does a typical well pump use?",
    a: "A typical residential well pump uses around 700–2,000 W running and roughly 2,000–6,000 W starting, depending on horsepower, motor design, and wiring distance. The best way to know for sure is to check the pump’s nameplate or control box and convert the listed full-load amps and locked-rotor amps to watts using watts = amps × volts."
  },
  {
    q: "Can a sump pump and well pump run on the same generator?",
    a: "Yes, but the generator must handle the combined running and starting demand. Sump pumps also have a significant inrush current, though usually lower than well pumps. When both pumps are mission-critical, many homeowners choose a 7,500–12,000 W portable or a right-sized standby generator and avoid starting both pumps at the exact same instant."
  },
  {
    q: "What size generator do I need for a well pump, sump pump, and fridge?",
    a: "For a common essentials-only setup with one 1/2–1 HP well pump, one 1/3–1/2 HP sump pump, and a refrigerator/freezer, many homes are well served by a 7,500–10,000 W generator. This assumes you do not start both pumps at the same moment and you’re not adding large additional loads like central AC or electric water heating."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I run a well pump directly off an extension cord?",
    a: "No. Well pumps are hard-wired appliances and should not be connected via extension cords. To run a well pump from a generator, the pump circuit should be supplied through a listed transfer switch or interlock so the wiring remains protected and there is no risk of backfeeding utility lines."
  },
  {
    q: "Does starting surge increase with pump age or wiring distance?",
    a: "Yes. Aging pumps often draw more current at startup as bearings wear and efficiency declines, and long wire runs add resistance that can increase the starting VA the generator must supply. If your pump is older or far from the panel, it’s wise to lean toward the higher end of generator sizing ranges or have an electrician confirm the actual load."
  },
  {
    q: "What about jet pumps?",
    a: "Jet pumps commonly used in shallow wells tend to have similar wattage requirements to submersible pumps of the same horsepower. A typical 3/4 HP jet pump may need roughly 1,000–1,600 W running and 3,000–4,500 W starting. Treat them like any other major motor load in your generator plan."

      <h1>Well &amp; Sump Pump FAQs</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Well pumps and sump pumps create some of the highest starting loads in a
        typical home. These FAQs explain how many watts they need, what size
        generator can run them, and how to plan for safe operation during an outage.

    <main>
      <p>
        If you’re new to generator sizing overall, you may want to start with the
        <a href="/generator-sizing-guide">Home Generator Sizing Guide</a> or the
        <a href="/faqs/general">General Generator FAQs</a>, then come back here to dial in
        your pump loads.
      </p>

      <h2>What size generator do I need to run a well pump?</h2>
      <p>
        The required generator size depends on the <strong>horsepower (HP)</strong>
        of your pump, the motor type (2-wire vs. 3-wire), and what else is running
        at the same time. Typical residential well pumps range from
        <strong>1/2 HP to 1 HP</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>General estimates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1/2 HP well pump</strong>: ~1,000 W running, 2,000–4,000 W starting</li>
        <li><strong>3/4 HP well pump</strong>: ~1,500 W running, 3,000–5,000 W starting</li>
        <li><strong>1 HP well pump</strong>: ~2,000 W running, 4,000–6,000 W starting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Pumps often draw <strong>2–3× their running watts</strong> at startup. That short surge
        is what determines whether your generator is large enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a typical 1/2–1 HP well pump, a generator in the
        <strong>4,000–7,500 W</strong> range is often sufficient, depending on what
        else is running at the same time. Larger homes, higher HP pumps, or longer
        wire runs may require a <strong>7,500–10,000 W portable</strong> or a standby system.
      </p>
      <p>
        To see how your well pump fits into the bigger picture, plug it into the
        <a href="/#calculator">generator sizing calculator</a> along with your other loads.
      </p>

      <h2>Can a portable generator run a well pump?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes—most portable generators in the <strong>4,000–7,500 W</strong> class can run
        a typical residential well pump, as long as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You’re not simultaneously starting other big motor loads.</li>
        <li>The generator has adequate surge capacity.</li>
        <li>The pump’s electrical circuit is connected via a transfer switch or interlock.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have a <strong>larger 1 HP pump</strong>, older equipment, or long wire
        runs (which increase starting demand), a <strong>larger 7,500–12,000 W
        portable</strong> may be more reliable.
      </p>

      <h2>How many watts does a typical well pump use?</h2>
      <p>
        It varies by motor type and HP rating, but these ranges cover most homes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Running watts</strong>: ~700–2,000 W</li>
        <li><strong>Starting watts</strong>: ~2,000–6,000 W</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The best way to know for sure is to check the pump’s nameplate or control box.
        If it lists <strong>FLA</strong> (full-load amps) and <strong>LRA</strong>
        (locked-rotor amps), you can convert to watts:
      </p>
      <pre><code>Watts = Amps × Volts</code></pre>
      <p>
        Example: a pump with 8 A FLA at 240 V uses roughly 1,920 W running.
      </p>

      <h2>Can a sump pump and well pump run on the same generator?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, but only if the generator can handle the <strong>combined starting load</strong>.
        Sump pumps also have significant inrush currents, although typically lower than well pumps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical sump pump ranges:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1/3 HP</strong>: 600–800 W running, 1,300–2,500 W starting</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 HP</strong>: 800–1,200 W running, 2,000–3,500 W starting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If both pumps start at the same time, the generator must handle:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Well pump surge (2,000–6,000 W)</li>
        <li>Plus sump pump surge (1,300–3,500 W)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is why many homes rely on a <strong>7,500–12,000 W portable</strong> or a
        right-sized standby unit when both pumps are mission-critical.
      </p>

      <h2>What size generator do I need for a well pump, sump pump, and fridge?</h2>
      <p>
        A very common “essentials-only” setup is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1/2–1 HP well pump</li>
        <li>1/3–1/2 HP sump pump</li>
        <li>Refrigerator/freezer</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In many cases, a generator in the <strong>7,500–10,000 W</strong> range works well
        for this combination, as long as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The pumps don’t start at the exact same moment.</li>
        <li>You’re not adding a major load (like a large AC or electric water heater).</li>
        <li>Your transfer switch wiring keeps these circuits isolated and safe.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Can I run a well pump directly off an extension cord?</h2>
      <p><strong>No.</strong> Well pumps are hard-wired appliances and should not be connected
      with an extension cord.</p>
      <p>
        To run a well pump from a generator, you need a
        <strong>transfer switch or interlock</strong> so the pump circuit can be powered safely
        without backfeeding the utility lines. For an overview of your options, see
        <a href="/transfer-switch-vs-interlock">Transfer Switch vs. Interlock</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your electrician will make sure the neutral, grounding, and bonding requirements are
        correct for your generator type. For broader generator safety guidance, including
        carbon monoxide precautions, see the
        <a
          href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Safety-Education/Safety-Education-Centers/Portable-Generator-Safety"

        </a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Does starting surge increase with pump age or wiring distance?</h2>
      <p>Yes—both can increase the current required at startup.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Aging pumps</strong> often draw higher inrush current as bearings wear
          and efficiency declines.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Longer wire runs</strong> to deep-well pumps add resistance, which can
          increase the starting VA the generator must supply.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If your well pump is older than about a decade or has a very long wiring run, lean
        toward the higher end of generator sizing ranges or ask an electrician to confirm
        the load.
      </p>

      <h2>What about jet pumps?</h2>
      <p>
        Jet pumps (commonly used in shallow wells) tend to have similar wattage requirements
        to submersible pumps of the same horsepower. A standard <strong>3/4 HP jet pump</strong>
        often needs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1,000–1,600 W running</li>
        <li>3,000–4,500 W starting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If your home uses a jet pump for both water supply and pressure boosting, factor
        that load into your generator plan just like a submersible well pump.
