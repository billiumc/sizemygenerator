      <h1>Portable Generator FAQs</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Portable generators can be a cost-effective way to keep essentials running
        during an outage—if they’re sized correctly and connected safely. These
        FAQs cover what a portable can realistically power, how to think about
        watts and amps, and why a transfer switch matters.
      </p>

    <main>
      <h2>What size portable generator do I need for my house?</h2>
      <p>
        It depends on whether you want to run <strong>only essentials</strong> or
        try to power a larger portion of the home. For typical U.S. homes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Basic essentials only</strong> (fridge/freezer, a few lights,
          phone/Internet, small window AC or space heater): often
          <strong>3,000–5,000&nbsp;W</strong> is enough with careful load management.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Essentials + some comfort</strong> (fridge, lights, well or sump
          pump, a small central AC or multiple window units): many households land
          in the <strong>7,500–12,000&nbsp;W</strong> portable range.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Whole-house coverage from a portable</strong> is uncommon and
          usually impractical. If you truly want “almost everything” powered,
          that’s typically a job for a right-sized standby generator instead.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The key question is not “Can this generator power my entire panel?” but
        rather “Which <strong>specific circuits</strong> do I want to back up, and
        what is their combined running and starting load?”
      </p>

      <h2>Can a 7,500 watt portable generator run a house?</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>7,500&nbsp;W (7.5&nbsp;kW)</strong> portable generator can run a
        surprising amount of a typical home’s <em>essential</em> loads when it’s
        connected through a proper transfer switch and used thoughtfully. For many
        gas-heated homes, 7,500&nbsp;W is enough to cover:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Refrigerator and freezer</li>
        <li>Well or sump pump (often not at the same instant as other big loads)</li>
        <li>Lighting in key rooms</li>
        <li>Home office/electronics</li>
        <li>Possibly a small central AC or a couple of window units, if sized carefully</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A 7,500&nbsp;W unit is typically rated around <strong>30–31 continuous
        amps at 240&nbsp;V</strong>, which is enough for many “essentials-plus”
        setups as long as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You avoid running electric ranges, large electric dryers, and big shop tools.</li>
        <li>You pay attention to what’s running at the same time (for example, don’t start the well pump and AC at the exact same moment).</li>
        <li>Your central AC system, if used, is on the smaller side or has a soft-start kit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A 7,500&nbsp;W portable will <strong>not</strong> substitute for a properly
        sized whole-house standby in a large, all-electric home. But for many
        gas-heated homes, it’s a solid “sweet spot” for outage comfort.
      </p>

      <h2>Is a 10,000–12,000 watt portable generator enough for most homes?</h2>
      <p>
        For many homes with gas heat and gas water heat, a
        <strong>10,000–12,000&nbsp;W</strong> portable can comfortably cover:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Refrigerator and freezer</li>
        <li>Well or sump pump</li>
        <li>Lighting and outlets in several rooms</li>
        <li>Home office equipment</li>
        <li>One reasonably sized central AC or several window units (if loads are managed)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Generators in this size range usually provide around <strong>40–50 amps at
        240&nbsp;V</strong>. That’s enough capacity for many homes’ essentials and
        some comfort loads, but you still need to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose which circuits are backed up via your transfer switch.</li>
        <li>Be aware of large motor starting surges (AC, pumps, compressors).</li>
        <li>Avoid running high-demand electric heat, ranges, and dryers simultaneously.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you find yourself wanting to power <em>everything</em> without thinking
        about what’s on, a properly sized standby system is usually a better fit.
      </p>

      <h2>How do I connect a portable generator to my home safely?</h2>
      <p>
        The safest and code-compliant way is to use a
        <strong>transfer switch or interlock kit</strong> designed for generators.
        The exact equipment depends on your panel and local code, but the general
        options are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>pre-wired generator transfer panel</strong> that feeds a small
          subpanel of selected “generator circuits.”
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>mechanical interlock kit</strong> on your main panel that prevents
          the main breaker and generator breaker from being on at the same time.
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>manual or automatic transfer switch</strong> located near the main
          service equipment.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        What you should <strong>never</strong> do is “backfeed” the panel by using
        a homemade cord into a dryer or range receptacle. That’s dangerous for you,
        dangerous for line workers, and it violates electrical codes.
      </p>
      <p>
        A licensed electrician can size the transfer equipment, ensure the neutral
        and grounding are handled correctly, and make sure everything passes
        inspection.
      </p>

      <h2>Can I run my portable generator inside the garage?</h2>
      <p><strong>No.</strong> Portable generators must be run outside.</p>
      <p>
        Even with the garage door open, a portable generator in a garage or under
        an attached carport can allow carbon monoxide (CO) to seep into the home.
        CO is colorless and odorless and can accumulate to dangerous levels before
        anyone notices.
      </p>
      <p>
        General safety guidance is to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Run portable generators outdoors, away from windows, doors, and vents.</li>
        <li>Follow the clearances and placement instructions in the owner’s manual.</li>
        <li>Use heavy-duty, outdoor-rated extension cords or a proper inlet and transfer switch.</li>
        <li>Make sure your home has working CO detectors.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How long can I run a portable generator continuously?</h2>
      <p>
        Most air-cooled portable generators are designed for
        <strong>extended use at partial load</strong>, but not to run at
        full output 24/7 without rest or maintenance. What limits runtime is a mix of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fuel capacity</strong> and how you’re refueling.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil change intervals</strong> (many portables specify 50–100 hours between oil changes).</li>
        <li>Ambient temperature and ventilation around the unit.</li>
        <li>How close you are to the generator’s maximum rating.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In real outages, many homeowners run portables for
        <strong>several hours at a time</strong>, then shut them down periodically
        to cool, check oil, and refuel during safe daylight conditions. For longer
        events, standby units that tie into natural gas or larger propane tanks are
        usually more practical than trying to keep a portable running around the clock.
      </p>

      <h2>Are inverter generators better for home backup?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Inverter generators</strong> produce cleaner power with lower
        harmonic distortion and can automatically throttle their engine speed based
        on load. Compared with conventional open-frame portables:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>They’re typically <strong>quieter</strong>.</li>
        <li>They often have <strong>better fuel efficiency at light load</strong>.</li>
        <li>They are generally more <strong>electronics-friendly</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The trade-offs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Inverter units often cost more per watt of capacity.</li>
        <li>Many popular inverter models top out around 3,000–7,000&nbsp;W.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For <strong>smaller essential loads</strong>, an inverter generator is an
        excellent choice. For larger whole-home loads, a conventional higher-wattage
        portable or a standby system is often more practical.
      </p>

      <h2>Can a portable generator run a central AC?</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes—if the generator is large enough, the AC system is reasonably
        efficient, and starting surge is managed. In practice:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Smaller <strong>2–3&nbsp;ton</strong> systems may be able to run on a
          <strong>7,500–12,000&nbsp;W</strong> portable, especially with a soft-start kit
          and careful load management.
        </li>
        <li>
          Larger <strong>4–5&nbsp;ton</strong> systems often push beyond what’s comfortable
          for typical portables and may require a standby generator instead.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Before counting on a portable to run central air, you should:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gather the AC nameplate data (amps, volts, LRA).</li>
        <li>Estimate running and starting kW for the system.</li>
        <li>Confirm with your electrician and HVAC contractor that your plan is realistic and safe.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Do I still need a transfer switch if I only plug loads in directly?</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re <strong>only</strong> plugging devices directly into the generator’s
        receptacles with extension cords, you are not backfeeding the house wiring,
        and a transfer switch is not strictly required for those cords.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this approach has limitations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It’s easy to overload a single receptacle or cord if you’re not careful.</li>
        <li>You can’t power hard-wired loads (like a furnace, well pump, or central AC) without a proper interconnection.</li>
        <li>Running multiple cords through doors and windows can be inconvenient and a tripping hazard.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As soon as you want to power <strong>household circuits</strong>—for example,
        a furnace circuit, a well pump circuit, or multiple rooms—a
        <strong>code-compliant transfer switch or interlock</strong> installed by an
        electrician is the right path.
