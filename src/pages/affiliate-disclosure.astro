      SizeMyGenerator.com is free to use. To help fund hosting, ongoing development, and content updates, we sometimes use
      <strong>affiliate links</strong> to products or services we genuinely recommend. If you click an affiliate link and make a purchase,
      we may earn a commission <strong>at no additional cost to you</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Editorial independence</h2>
    <p>
      Recommendations on this site are driven by practical assumptions, field experience, and the methodology described on our
      <a href="/about">About</a> page—not by payments. We do not sell placement, and partners cannot buy favorable coverage.
    </p>

    <h2>What is an affiliate link?</h2>
    <p>
      An affiliate link is a standard URL that tells the retailer a visitor came from our site. If you purchase after clicking,
      the retailer may pay us a small referral fee. Pricing is the same for you.
    </p>

    <h2>Which retailers?</h2>
    <p>
      We may link to well‑known retailers and manufacturers. Specific partners can change over time. When a link is an affiliate link,
      we aim to make that clear via nearby text or context.
    </p>

    <h2>Tracking & privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Some affiliate programs use cookies or similar technologies to attribute a purchase to our site. For details on what data we collect,
      how it’s used, and how to opt out, please review our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>

      If you have any questions about this disclosure, please <a href="mailto:bill@atacamahvac.com">email us</a>.
