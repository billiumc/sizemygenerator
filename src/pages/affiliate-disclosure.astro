        SizeMyGenerator.com is free to use. To help fund hosting, ongoing development, and content updates,
        we sometimes use <strong>affiliate links</strong> to products or services we genuinely recommend.
        If you click an affiliate link and make a purchase, we may earn a commission
        <strong> at no additional cost to you</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Editorial independence</h2>
      <p>
        Recommendations on this site are driven by practical assumptions, field experience, and the methodology
        described on our <a href="/about">About</a> page—not by payments. We do not sell placement, and partners
        cannot buy favorable coverage.
      </p>

      <h2>What is an affiliate link?</h2>
      <p>
        An affiliate link is a standard URL that tells the retailer a visitor came from our site. If you purchase
        after clicking, the retailer may pay us a small referral fee. Pricing is the same for you.
      </p>

      <h2>Which retailers?</h2>
      <p>
        We may link to well-known retailers and manufacturers. Specific partners can change over time. When a link
        is an affiliate link, we aim to make that clear via nearby text or context.
      </p>

      <h2>Tracking &amp; privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Some affiliate programs use cookies or similar technologies to attribute a purchase to our site.
        For details on what data we collect, how it’s used, and how to opt out, please review our
        <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>
        If you have any questions about this disclosure, please
