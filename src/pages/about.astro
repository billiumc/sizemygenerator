    <h1>About Size My Generator</h1>
    <p>
      A simple, practical tool from a licensed HVAC pro to help you think through backup power—without the fluff.
    </p>

    <h2>About SizeMyGenerator.com</h2>
    <p>
      Practical, no-nonsense generator sizing guidance—free to use and updated as assumptions improve.
    </p>

    <h2>Who’s behind this</h2>
    <p>
      I’m an HVAC professional with hands-on experience sizing, installing, and servicing residential systems.
      I built this calculator so families who don’t speak kilowatts all day can quickly get to a sensible starting
      point—before talking to a pro.
    </p>

    <h1>About this calculator</h1>
    <p>
      This site helps homeowners ballpark a generator size using a simplified interpretation of the
      National Electrical Code (NEC) dwelling load method, tailored for
      <strong>residential optional standby systems</strong>.
    </p>

      <h2>How the calculator works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Square-footage general load:</strong> <code>3&nbsp;VA/ft²</code> based on the area you enter (NEC&nbsp;2023 approach includes garage &amp; basement).</li>
        <li><strong>Required small-appliance &amp; laundry circuits:</strong> <code>1,500&nbsp;VA</code> each × quantity.</li>
        <li><strong>Fixed appliances:</strong> user-selected nameplate running watts at <strong>100%</strong> (well, sump, dishwasher, range, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Demand factor:</strong> apply <strong>first 10&nbsp;kVA at 100%</strong>, then <strong>the remainder at 40%</strong> to the non-A/C portion.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonal maximum (heating vs cooling):</strong> add <strong>100% of the larger</strong> of A/C or heating. For heat pumps with electric supplemental heat we add the A/C run plus <strong>65%</strong> of supplemental kW.</li>
        <li><strong>EV charging (Level 2):</strong> added at <strong>100%</strong> based on selected amperage (32/40/48/60/80A @240V) or a custom kW.</li>
        <li><strong>Headroom buffer:</strong> default <strong>20%</strong>. We divide by <code>(1 − buffer)</code> and round up to the next common generator size (10/14/18/22/24/26&nbsp;kW air-cooled).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        Assumptions reflect typical residential equipment and are updated periodically. Always verify against nameplates and
        local code amendments.

      <h2>What this site is (and isn’t)</h2>
      <p>
        This tool is oriented to <strong>residential optional standby systems</strong> (NEC Article&nbsp;702). It is <em>not</em> intended for
        <strong>emergency systems</strong> (Article&nbsp;700), <strong>legally required standby</strong> (Article&nbsp;701), or
        <strong>critical operations power systems</strong> (Article&nbsp;708), which have different design, reliability, and code
        requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is <strong>planning guidance</strong>, not a site survey. Homes vary, nameplates can surprise, and local AHJs may amend the
        NEC. Before purchasing or installing a generator, <strong>consult a licensed electrician/contractor</strong> and your utility
        to confirm sizing, transfer equipment, interconnection rules, and code compliance.
